## Installing the React Chat UI Kit

<Warning>
**Important**

Please follow the steps provided in the Key Concepts to create V3 apps before
you proceed.

</Warning>

### Setup

1. Register on CometChat

   - To install React UI Kit, you need to first register on the CometChat
     Dashboard. Click [here](https://app.cometchat.com/signup) to Sign Up.

2. Get your application keys

   - Create a new app.
   - Head over to the QuickStart or API & Auth Keys section and note the App ID,
     Auth Key, and Region.

3. Add the CometChat dependency

```bash CLI
npm install @cometchat-pro/chat@3.0.11 --save
```

### Configure CometChat inside your app

- Import CometChat SDK

```js Javascript
import { CometChat } from "@cometchat-pro/chat";
```

- Initialize CometChat

The init() method initializes the settings required for CometChat. We suggest
calling the init() method on app startup, preferably in the index.js file.

```js Javascript
const appID = "APP_ID";
const region = "REGION";
const appSetting = new CometChat.AppSettingsBuilder()
  .subscribePresenceForAllUsers()
  .setRegion(region)
  .build();
CometChat.init(appID, appSetting).then(
  () => {
    console.log("Initialization completed successfully");
    // You can now call login function.
  },
  (error) => {
    console.log("Initialization failed with error:", error);
    // Check the reason for error and take appropriate action.
  }
);
```

<Note>
  Replace APP_ID and REGION with your CometChat App ID and Region in the above
  code.
</Note>

- Create user

This method takes a `User` object and the `Auth Key` as input parameters and
returns the created `User` object if the request is successful.

```js Javascript
let authKey = "AUTH_KEY";
var uid = "user1";
var name = "Kevin";
​
var user = new CometChat.User(uid);
user.setName(name);
CometChat.createUser(user, authKey).then(
    user => {
        console.log("user created", user);
    },error => {
        console.log("error", error);
    }
)
```

<Note>Replace AUTH_KEY with your CometChat Auth Key in the above code.</Note>

- Login your user

This method takes `UID` and `Auth Key` as input parameters and returns the User
object containing all the information of the logged-in user.

```js Javascript
const authKey = "AUTH_KEY";
const uid = "SUPERHERO1";
​
CometChat.login(uid, authKey).then(
  user => {
    console.log("Login Successful:", { user });
  },
  error => {
    console.log("Login failed with exception:", { error });
  }
);
```

<Note>Replace `AUTH_KEY` with your CometChat Auth Key in the above code.</Note>

<Info>
We have set up 5 users for testing having UIDs: `SUPERHERO1`, `SUPERHERO2`, `SUPERHERO3`, `SUPERHERO4`, and `SUPERHERO5`.

We have used uid `SUPERHERO1` as an example here. You can create a User from
CometChat Dashboard as well.

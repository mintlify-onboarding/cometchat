As you can see in the above diagram, every message belongs to a particular
category. A message can belong to either one of the 4 categories

1. Message
2. Custom
3. Action
4. Call

Each category can be further be classified into types.

#Message A message belonging to the category `message` can be classified into
either 1 of the below types:

1. text - A plain text message
2. image- An image message
3. video- A video message
4. audio- An audio message
5. file- A file message

### Custom

In the case of messages that belong to the `custom` category, there are no
predefined types. Custom messages can be used by developers to send messages
that do not fit in the default category and types provided by CometChat. For
messages with the category `custom`, the developers can set their own type to
uniquely identify the custom message. A very good example of a custom message
would be the sharing of location co-ordinates. In this case, the developer can
decide to use the custom message with type set to `location`.

### Action

Action messages are system-generated messages. Messages belonging to the
`action` category can further be classified into one of the below types:

1. groupMember - action performed on a group member.
2. message - action performed on a message.

Action messages hold another property called `action` which actually determine
the action that has been performed For the type `groupMember` the action can be
either one of the below:

1. joined - when a group member joins a group
2. left - when a group member leaves a group
3. kicked - when a group member is kicked from the group
4. banned - when a group member is banned from the group
5. unbanned - when a group member is unbanned from the group
6. added - when a user is added to the group
7. scopeChanged - When the scope of a group member is changed.

For the type `message`, the action can be either one of the below:

edited - when a message is edited. deleted - when a message is deleted.

### Call

Messages with the category `call` are Calling related messages. These can belong
to either one of the 2 types

1. audio
2. video

The call messages have a property called status that helps you figure out the
status of the call. The status can be either one of the below values:

1. initiated - when a is initiated to a user/group
2. ongoing - when the receiver of the call has accepted the call
3. canceled - when the call has been canceled by the initiator of the call
4. rejected - when the call has been rejected by the receiver of the call
5. unanswered - when the call was not answered by the receiver.
6. busy - when the receiver of the call was busy on another call.
7. ended - when the call was successfully completed and ended by either the
   initiator or receiver.

<Info title='Info'>
    The rate limits below are for general applications. Rate limits can be adjusted on a per need basis, depending on your use-case and plan.
</Info>

1. App Level Rate Limit - request per app per min
2. APIKey Rate Limit - request per APIKey per min
3. User Level Rate Limit - request per login per min

<Info title='Info'>
    The rate limits will be cumulative i.e. Suppose the rate limit for core operations is 100/min. Then the customer can either login, join group or leave group etc. for total 100/min.
</Info>

| Rate Limiting Groups | 100       | 1K       | 2500     | 5K        | 10K       |
| -------------------- | --------- | -------- | -------- | --------- | --------- |
| Standard Operations  | 20k req   | 20k req  | 20k req  | 20k req   | 20k req   |
| Core Operations      | 10k req   | 10k req  | 10k req  | 10k req   | 10k req   |

## What happens when rate limit is reached?
The request isn't processed and a response is sent containing a 429 response code. Along with the response code there will be couple of headers sent which specifies the time in seconds that you must wait before you can try request again.

`Retry-After: 15`
`X-Rate-Limit-Reset: 1625143246` 

## Is there any endpoint that returns rate limit of all resources?

No, we don't provide a rate-limit endpoint.

However, we do provide the following response headers that you can use to confirm the app's current rate limit and monitor the number of requests remaining in the current minute:

`X-Rate-Limit: 700`

`X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: 699`

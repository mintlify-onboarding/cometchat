  "Calling is a core feature of CometChat. CometChat allows two mechanisms for
  calling"
---

1. **Direct Calling**
2. **Default Calling**

## Direct Calling

Direct Calling allows you to start the call/conference sessions directly with
the session Id of your choice. All the users joining the same session Id are
connected to the same call/conference. For more information on Direct Calling,
please visit the [Direct Calling docs](/sdks/javascript/calling/direct).

## Default Calling

The second approach that CometChat allows is to implement the entire calling
flow where one user initiates a call/conference and other user/users who want to
be a part of the call accept/reject the call. All the users that accept the call
are connected to the same session. For more information on Default Calling,
please visit the [Default Calling docs](/sdks/javascript/calling/default).

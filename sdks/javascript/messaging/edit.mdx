title: "Edit a Message"
---

While [editing a message](#edit-a-message) is straightforward, receiving events
for edited messages with CometChat has two parts:

1. Adding a listener to receive
   [real-time message edits](#real-time-message-edit-events) when your app is
   running
2. Calling a method to retrieve
   [missed message edits](#missed-message-edit-events) when your app was not
   running

## Edit a Message

_In other words, as a sender, how do I edit a message?_

In order to edit a message, you can use the `editMessage()` method. This method
takes an object of the `BaseMessage` class. At the moment, you are only allowed
to edit `TextMessage` and `CustomMessage`. Thus, the `BaseMessage` object must
either be a Text or a Custom Message.

### Add/Update Tags

While editing a message, you can update the tags associated with the Message.
You can use the `setTags()` method to do so. The tags added while editing a
message will replace the tags set when the message was sent.

<CodeGroup>

```js Text Message
let tags = ["pinnedMessage"];
​
textMessage.setTags(tags);
```

```js Custom Message
let tags = ["pinnedMessage"];

customMessage.setTags(tags);
```

```ts Text Message (Typescript)
let tags: Array<String> = ["pinnedMessage"];

textMessage.setTags(tags);
```

```ts Custom Message (Typescript)
let tags: Array<String> = ["pinnedMessage"];

customMessage.setTags(tags);
```

</CodeGroup>

Once the message object is ready, you can use the editMessage() method and pass
the message object to it.

<CodeGroup>

```js Edit Message
let receiverID = "RECEIVER_UID";
let messageText = "Hello world!";
let receiverType = CometChat.RECEIVER_TYPE.USER;
let messageId = "MESSAGE_ID_OF_THE_MESSAGE_TO_BE_EDITED";
let textMessage = new CometChat.TextMessage(receiverID, messageText, receiverType);
​
textMessage.setId(messageId);
​
CometChat.editMessage(textMessage).then(
  message => {
    console.log("Message Edited", message);
  }, error => {
    console.log("Message editing failed with error:", error);
  }
);
```

```ts Typescript
let receiverID: string = "RECEIVER_UID";
let messageText: string = "Hello world!";
let receiverType: string = CometChat.RECEIVER_TYPE.USER;
let messageId: number = 1;
let textMessage: CometChat.TextMessage = new CometChat.TextMessage(
  receiverID,
  messageText,
  receiverType
);

textMessage.setId(messageId);

CometChat.editMessage(textMessage).then(
  (message: CometChat.TextMessage) => {
    console.log("Message Edited", message);
  },
  (error: CometChat.CometChatException) => {
    console.log("Message editing failed with error:", error);
  }
);
```

</CodeGroup>

The object of the edited message will be returned in the `onSuccess()` callback
method of the listener. The message object will contain the `editedAt` field set
with the timestamp of the time the message was edited. This will help you
identify if the message was edited while iterating through the list of messages.
The `editedBy` field is also set to the UID of the user who edited the message.

By default, CometChat allows certain roles to edit a message.

| User Role       | Conversation Type       | Edit Capabilities          |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Message Sender  | One-on-One Conversation | Messages they have sent.   |
| Message Sender  | Group Conversation      | Messages they have sent.   |
| Group Owner     | Group Conversation      | All messages in the group. |
| Group Moderator | Group Conversation      | All messages in the group. |

## Real-time Message Edit Events

_In other words, as a recipient, how do I know when someone has edited their
message when my app is running?_

In order to receive real-time events for message being edited, you need to
override the `onMessageEdited()` method of the `MessageListener` class.

<CodeGroup>

```js Message Listener
let listenerID = "UNIQUE_LISTENER_ID";
​
CometChat.addMessageListener(
  listenerID,
  new CometChat.MessageListener({
    onMessageEdited: message => {
      console.log("Edited Message", message);
    }
  })
);
```

```ts Typescript
let listenerID: string = "UNIQUE_LISTENER_ID";

CometChat.addMessageListener(
  listenerID,
  new CometChat.MessageListener({
    onMessageEdited: (message: CometChat.BaseMessage) => {
      console.log("Edited Message", message);
    },
  })
);
```

</CodeGroup>

## Missed Message Edit Events

_In other words, as a recipient, how do I know when someone edited their message
when my app was not running?_

When you retrieve the list of previous messages, for the message that was
edited, the `editedAt` and the `editedBy` fields will be set. Also, for example,
of the total number of messages for a conversation are 100, and the message with
message ID 50 was edited. Now the message with id 50 will have the `editedAt`
and the `editedBy` fields set whenever it is pulled from the history. Also, the
101st message will be and [Action] message informing you that the message with
id 50 has been edited.

For the message edited event, in the `Action` object received, the following
fields can help you get the relevant information-

1. `action` - edited
2. `actionOn` - Updated message object with the edited details.
3. `actionBy` - User object containing the details of the user who has edited
   the message.
4. `actionFor` - User/group object having the details of the receiver to which
   the message was sent.

<Note>
**Important**

In order to edit a message, you need to be either the sender of the message or
the admin/moderator of the group in which the message was sent.

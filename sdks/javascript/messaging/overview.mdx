  "Messaging is one of the core features of CometChat. We've thoughtfully
  created methods to help you send, receive and fetch message history."
---

At the minimum, you must add code for
[sending messages](/sdks/javascript/messaging/send) and
[receiving messages](/sdks/javascript/messaging/receive) .

Once you've implemented that, you can proceed to more advanced features like
[typing indicators](/sdks/javascript/messaging/typing-indicators) and
[delivery & read receipts](/sdks/javascript/messaging/delivery).

In case you want to delete a conversation, you can use the
`deleteConversation()` method.

This method takes two parameters. The unique id (UID/GUID) of the conversation
to be deleted & the type (user/group) of conversation to be deleted.

let UID = "UID";

CometChat.deleteConversation(UID, type).then(
  (deletedConversation) => {

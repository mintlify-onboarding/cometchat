## Send a Typing Indicator

_In other words, as a sender, how do I let the recipient(s) know that I'm
typing?_

### Start Typing

You can use the `startTyping()` method to inform the receiver that the logged in
user has started typing. The receiver will receive this information in the
`onTypingStarted()` method of the `MessageListener` class. In order to send the
typing indicator, you need to use the `TypingIndicator` class.

<CodeGroup>

```js Start Typing (User)
let receiverId = "UID";
let receiverType = CometChat.RECEIVER_TYPE.USER;

let typingNotification = new CometChat.TypingIndicator(
  receiverId,
  receiverType
);
CometChat.startTyping(typingNotification);
```

```js Start Typing (Group)
let receiverId = "GUID";
let receiverType = CometChat.RECEIVER_TYPE.GROUP;

let typingNotification = new CometChat.TypingIndicator(
  receiverId,
  receiverType
);
CometChat.startTyping(typingNotification);
```

```ts Start User Typing (Typescript)
let receiverId: string = "UID";
let receiverType: string = CometChat.RECEIVER_TYPE.USER;

let typingNotification: CometChat.TypingIndicator =
  new CometChat.TypingIndicator(receiverId, receiverType);
CometChat.startTyping(typingNotification);
```

```ts Start Group Typing (Typescript)
let receiverId: string = "GUID";
let receiverType: string = CometChat.RECEIVER_TYPE.GROUP;

let typingNotification: CometChat.TypingIndicator =
  new CometChat.TypingIndicator(receiverId, receiverType);
CometChat.startTyping(typingNotification);
```

</CodeGroup>

### Stop Typing

You can use the `endTyping()` method to inform the receiver that the logged in
user has stopped typing. The receiver will receive this information in the
`onTypingEnded()` method of the `MessageListener` class. In order to send the
typing indicator, you need to use the `TypingIndicator` class.

<CodeGroup>

```js Start Typing (User)
let receiverId = "UID";
let receiverType = CometChat.RECEIVER_TYPE.USER;

let typingNotification = new CometChat.TypingIndicator(
  receiverId,
  receiverType
);
CometChat.endTyping(typingNotification);
```

```js Start Typing (Group)
let receiverId = "GUID";
let receiverType = CometChat.RECEIVER_TYPE.GROUP;

let typingNotification = new CometChat.TypingIndicator(
  receiverId,
  receiverType
);
CometChat.endTyping(typingNotification);
```

```ts Start User Typing (Typescript)
let receiverId: string = "UID";
let receiverType: string = CometChat.RECEIVER_TYPE.USER;

let typingNotification: CometChat.TypingIndicator =
  new CometChat.TypingIndicator(receiverId, receiverType);
CometChat.endTyping(typingNotification);
```

```ts Start Group Typing (Typescript)
let receiverId: string = "GUID";
let receiverType: string = CometChat.RECEIVER_TYPE.GROUP;

let typingNotification: CometChat.TypingIndicator =
  new CometChat.TypingIndicator(receiverId, receiverType);
CometChat.endTyping(typingNotification);
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
**Custom Data**

You can use the `metadata` field of the `TypingIndicator` class to pass
additional data along with the typing indicators. The metadata field is a
`JSONObject` and can be set using the `setMetadata()` method of the
`TypingIndicator` class. This data will be received at the receiver end and can
be obtained using the `getMetadata()` method.

</Note>

## Real-time Typing Indicators

_In other words, as a recipient, how do I know when someone is typing?_

You will receive the typing indicators in the `onTypingStarted()` and the
`onTypingEnded()` method of the registered `MessageListener` class.

<CodeGroup>

```js Message Listener
let listenerId = "UNIQUE_LITENER_ID";
â€‹
CometChat.addMessageListener(
  listenerId,
  new CometChat.MessageListener({
    onTypingStarted: typingIndicator => {
      console.log("Typing started :", typingIndicator);
    },
    onTypingEnded: typingIndicator => {
      console.log("Typing ended :", typingIndicator);
    }
  })
);
```

```ts Typescript
let listenerId: string = "UNIQUE_LITENER_ID";

CometChat.addMessageListener(
  listenerId,
  new CometChat.MessageListener({
    onTypingStarted: (typingIndicator: CometChat.TypingIndicator) => {
      console.log("Typing started :", typingIndicator);
    },
    onTypingEnded: (typingIndicator: CometChat.TypingIndicator) => {
      console.log("Typing ended :", typingIndicator);
    },
  })
);
```

</CodeGroup>

The `TypingIndicator` class consists of the below parameters:

| Parameter    | Information                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| sender       | An object of the User class holding all the information. related to the sender of the typing indicator.                                                                                          |
| receiverId   | Unique Id of the receiver. This can be the Id of the group or the user the typing indicator is sent to.                                                                                          |
| receiverType | This parameter indicates if the typing indicator is to be sent to a user or a group. The possible values are: <br /> 1. `CometChat.RECEIVER_TYPE.USER` <br /> 2. `CometChat.RECEIVER_TYPE.GROUP` |
| metadata     | A JSONObject to provider additional data.                                                                                                                                                        |

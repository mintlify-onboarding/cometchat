The `MessagesRequest` class as you must be familiar with helps you to fetch
messages based on the various parameters provided to it. This document will help
you understand better the various options that are available using the
`MessagesRequest` class.

The `MessagesRequest` class is designed using the Builder design pattern. In
order to obtain an object of the `MessagesRequest` class, you will have to make
use of the `MessagesRequestBuilder` class in the `MessagesRequest` class.

The `MessagesRequestBuilder` class allows you to set various parameters to the
`MessagesRequest` class based on which the messages are fetched.

Steps to generate an object of the `MessagesRequest` class:

1. Create an object of the `MessagesRequestBuilder` class. 2.. Set all the
   parameters you wish to set.
2. Call the `build()` method of the `MessagesRequestBuilder` class to get an
   object of the `MessagesRequest` class.

Once you have an object of the `MessagesRequest` class, you can call either the
`fetchNext()` method or the `fetchPrevious()` method using the object.

1. fetchNext() - Calling this method will return the messages after the
   specified parameters.
2. fetchPrevious() - Calling this method will give you messages before the
   specified parameters.

Since messages are obtained in a paginated manner, a maximum of 100 messages can
be pulled in a single iteration. Calling the `fetchPrevious()`/`fetchNext()`
method on the same `MessagesRequest` object will get you the next set of
messages.

Now that you are clear how to use the `MessagesRequest` class, below are the
various options available:

## Number of messages fetched

_In other words, how do I set the number of messages fetched in a single
iteration_

To achieve this, you can use the `setLimit()` method. This method takes an
integer value as the input and informs the SDK to fetch the specified number of
messages in one iteration. The maximum number of messages that can be fetched in
one go is 100.

<CodeGroup>

```js Javascript
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
  .setLimit(50)
  .build();
```

```ts Typescript
let messagesRequest: CometChat.MessagesRequest =
  new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder().setLimit(50).build();
```

</CodeGroup>

## Messages for a user conversation

_In other words, how do I fetch messages between me and any user_

This can be achieved using the `setUID()` method. This method takes the UID of
the user with whom the conversation is to be fetched. When a valid UID is
passed, the SDK will return all the messages that are a part of the conversation
between the logged-in user and the UID that has been specified.

<CodeGroup>

```js User Conversation
let UID = "UID";
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
  .setUID(UID)
  .setLimit(50)
  .build();
```

```ts Typescript
let UID: string = "UID",
  messagesRequest: CometChat.MessagesRequest =
    new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder().setUID(UID).setLimit(50).build();
```

</CodeGroup>

### Messages for a group conversation

_In other words, how do I fetch messages for any group conversation_

You can achieve this using the `setGUID()` method. This method takes the GUID of
a group for which the conversations are to be fetched. Passing a valid GUID to
this method will return all the messages that are a part of the group
conversation. Please note that the logged-in user must be a member of the group
to fetch the messages for that group.

<CodeGroup>

```js Group Conversation
let GUID = "GUID";
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
  .setGUID(GUID)
  .setLimit(50)
  .build();
```

``ts Typescript let GUID: string = "GUID", messagesRequest:
CometChat.MessagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
.setGUID(GUID) .setLimit(50) .build();

````

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
**Important**

If none of the above two methods setUID() and setGUID() is used, all the messages for the logged-in user will be fetched. This means that messages from all the one-on-one and group conversations which the logged-in user is a part of will be returned. All the parameters discussed below can be used along with the setUID() or setGUID() or without any of the two to fetch all the messages that the logged-in user is a part of.

</Note>

## Messages before/after a message

_In other words, how do I fetch messages before or after a particular message_

This can be achieved using the `setMessageId()` method. This method takes the message-id as input and provides messages only after/before the message-id based on if the `fetchNext()` or `fetchPrevious()` method is triggered.

<CodeGroup>

```js User
let UID = "UID";
let messageId = 1;
let limit = 30;
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
                        .setUID(UID)
                        .setMessageId(messageId)
                        .setLimit(limit)
                        .build();
````

```js Group
let GUID = "GUID";
let messageId = 1;
let limit = 30;
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
  .setGUID(GUID)
  .setMessageId(messageId)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .build();
```

```ts Typescript (User)
let UID: string = "UID",
  messageId: number = 1,
  limit: number = 30,
  messagesRequest: CometChat.MessagesRequest =
    new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
      .setUID(UID)
      .setMessageId(messageId)
      .setLimit(limit)
      .build();
```

```ts Typescript (Group)
let GUID: string = "GUID",
  messageId: number = 1,
  limit: number = 30,
  messagesRequest: CometChat.MessagesRequest =
    new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
      .setGUID(GUID)
      .setMessageId(messageId)
      .setLimit(limit)
      .build();
```

</CodeGroup>

This method can be used along with `setUID()` or `setGUID()` methods to fetch
messages after/before any specific message-id for a particular user/group
conversation.

## Messages before/after a given time

_In other words, how do I fetch messages before or after a particular date or
time_

You can easily achieve this using the `setTimestamp()` method. This method takes
the Unix timestamp as input and provides messages only after/before the
timestamp based on if `fetchNext()` or `fetchPrevious()` method is triggered.

<CodeGroup>

```js User
let UID = "UID";
let timestamp = 1602221371;
let limit = 30;
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
  .setUID(UID)
  .setTimestamp(timestamp)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .build();
```

```js Group
let GUID = "GUID";
let timestamp = 1602221371;
let limit = 30;
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
  .setGUID(GUID)
  .setTimestamp(timestamp)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .build();
```

```ts Typescript (User)
let UID: string = "UID",
  timestamp: number = 1602221371,
  limit: number = 30,
  messagesRequest: CometChat.MessagesRequest =
    new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
      .setUID(UID)
      .setTimestamp(timestamp)
      .setLimit(limit)
      .build();
```

```ts Typescript (Group)
let GUID: string = "GUID",
  timestamp: number = 1602221371,
  limit: number = 30,
  messagesRequest: CometChat.MessagesRequest =
    new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
      .setGUID(GUID)
      .setTimestamp(timestamp)
      .setLimit(limit)
      .build();
```

</CodeGroup>

This method can be used along with `setUID()` or `setGUID()` methods to fetch
messages after/before any specific date or time for a particular user/group
conversation.

## Unread messages

_In other words, how do I fetch unread messages_

This can easily be achieved using setting the unread flag to true. For this, you
need to use the `setUnread()` method. This method takes a boolean value as
input. If the value is set to true, the SDK will return just the unread
messages.

<CodeGroup>

```js User
let UID = "UID";
let limit = 30;
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
  .setUID(UID)
  .setUnread(true)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .build();
```

```js Group
let GUID = "GUID";
let limit = 30;
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
  .setGUID(GUID)
  .setUnread(true)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .build();
```

```ts Typescript (User)
let UID: string = "UID",
  limit: number = 30,
  messagesRequest: CometChat.MessagesRequest =
    new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
      .setUID(UID)
      .setUnread(true)
      .setLimit(limit)
      .build();
```

```ts Typescript (Group)
let GUID: string = "GUID",
  limit: number = 30,
  messagesRequest: CometChat.MessagesRequest =
    new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
      .setGUID(GUID)
      .setUnread(true)
      .setLimit(limit)
      .build();
```

</CodeGroup>

This method along with setGUID() or setUID() can be used to fetch unread
messages for a particular group or user conversation respectively.

## Exclude messages from blocked users

_In other words, how do I fetch messages excluding the messages from the users I
have blocked_

This can be easily achieved using the `hideMessagesFromBlockedUsers()` method.
This method accepts a boolean value which determines if the messages from users
blocked by the logged-in user need to be a part if the fetched messages. If the
value is set to true, the messages will be hidden and won't be a part of the
messages fetched. The default value is false i.e if this method is not used, the
messages from blocked users will be included in the fetched messages.

<CodeGroup>

```js User
let UID = "UID";
let limit = 30;
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
  .setUID(UID)
  .hideMessagesFromBlockedUsers(true)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .build();
```

```js Group
let GUID = "GUID";
let limit = 30;
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
  .setGUID(GUID)
  .hideMessagesFromBlockedUsers(true)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .build();
```

```ts Typescript (User)
let UID: string = "UID",
  limit: number = 30,
  messagesRequest: CometChat.MessagesRequest =
    new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
      .setUID(UID)
      .hideMessagesFromBlockedUsers(true)
      .setLimit(limit)
      .build();
```

```ts Typescript (Group)
let GUID: string = "GUID",
  limit: number = 30,
  messagesRequest: CometChat.MessagesRequest =
    new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
      .setGUID(GUID)
      .hideMessagesFromBlockedUsers(true)
      .setLimit(limit)
      .build();
```

</CodeGroup>

This method can be used to hide the messages by users blocked by logged in user
in groups that both the members are a part of.

## Updated and received messages

_In other words, how do I fetch messages that have been received or updated
after a particular date or time_

This method accepts a Unix timestamp value and will return all the messages that
have been updated and the ones that have been sent/received after the specified
time. The messages updated could mean the messages that have been marked as
read/delivered or if the messages are edited or deleted.

<CodeGroup>

```js User
let UID = "UID";
let limit = 30;
let timestamp = 1602221371;
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
  .setUID(UID)
  .setUpdatedAfter(timestamp)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .build();
```

```js Group
let GUID = "GUID";
let limit = 30;
let timestamp = 1602221371;
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
  .setGUID(GUID)
  .setUpdatedAfter(timestamp)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .build();
```

```ts Typescript (User)
let UID: string = "UID",
  limit: number = 30,
  timestamp: string = "1602221371",
  messagesRequest: CometChat.MessagesRequest =
    new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
      .setUID(UID)
      .setUpdatedAfter(timestamp)
      .setLimit(limit)
      .build();
```

```ts Typescript (Group)
let GUID: string = "GUID",
  limit: number = 30,
  timestamp: string = "1602221371",
  messagesRequest: CometChat.MessagesRequest =
    new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
      .setGUID(GUID)
      .setUpdatedAfter(timestamp)
      .setLimit(limit)
      .build();
```

</CodeGroup>

This can be useful in finding the messages that have been received or updated
after a certain time. Can prove very useful if you are saving the messages
locally and would like to know the messages that have been updated or received
after the last message available in your local databases.

## Updated messages only

_In other words, how do I fetch messages that have been updated after a
particular date or time_

This can be achieved easily by setting the updatesOnly parameter to true. To do
so, you can use the `updatesOnly()` method. This method takes a boolean input
and can be used with the `setUpdatedAfter()` method to get jus the updated
messages and not the messages sent/received after the specified time. This
method cannot be used independently and always needs to be used with the
setUpdatedAfter() method.

<CodeGroup>

```js User
let UID = "UID";
let limit = 30;
let timestamp = 1602221371;
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
  .setUID(UID)
  .setUpdatedAfter(timestamp)
  .updatesOnly(true)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .build();
```

```js Group
let GUID = "GUID";
let limit = 30;
let timestamp = 1602221371;
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
  .setGUID(GUID)
  .setUpdatedAfter(timestamp)
  .updatesOnly(true)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .build();
```

```ts Typescript (User)
let UID: string = "UID",
  limit: number = 30,
  timestamp: string = "1602221371",
  messagesRequest: CometChat.MessagesRequest =
    new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
      .setUID(UID)
      .setUpdatedAfter(timestamp)
      .updatesOnly(true)
      .setLimit(limit)
      .build();
```

```ts Typescript (Group)
let GUID: string = "GUID",
  limit: number = 30,
  timestamp: string = "1602221371",
  messagesRequest: CometChat.MessagesRequest =
    new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
      .setGUID(GUID)
      .setUpdatedAfter(timestamp)
      .updatesOnly(true)
      .setLimit(limit)
      .build();
```

</CodeGroup>

## Messages for multiple categories

_In other words, how do I fetch messages belonging to multiple categories_

We recommend before trying this, you refer to the Message structure and
hierarchy guide to get familiar with the various categories of messages.

For this, you will have to use the `setCategories()` method. This method accepts
a list of categories. This tells the SDK to fetch messages only belonging to
these categories.

<CodeGroup>

```js User
let UID = "UID";
let limit = 30;
let categories = ["message", "custom"];
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
  .setUID(UID)
  .setCategories(categories)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .build();
```

```js Group
let GUID = "GUID";
let limit = 30;
let categories = ["message", "custom"];
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
  .setGUID(GUID)
  .setCategories(categories)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .build();
```

```ts Typescript (User)
let UID: string = "UID",
  limit: number = 30,
  categories: Array<String> = ["message", "custom"],
  messagesRequest: CometChat.MessagesRequest =
    new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
      .setUID(UID)
      .setCategories(categories)
      .setLimit(limit)
      .build();
```

```ts Typescript (Group)
let GUID: string = "GUID",
  limit: number = 30,
  categories: Array<String> = ["message", "custom"],
  messagesRequest: CometChat.MessagesRequest =
    new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
      .setGUID(GUID)
      .setCategories(categories)
      .setLimit(limit)
      .build();
```

</CodeGroup>

The above snippet will help you get only the messages belonging to the message
and custom category. This can also be used to disable certain categories of
messages like call and action.

## Messages for multiple types

_In other words, how do I fetch messages belonging to multiple types_

We recommend before trying this, you refer to the Message structure and
hierarchy guide to get familiar with the various types of messages.

This can be easily achieved using the `setTypes()` method. This method accepts a
list of types. This tells the SDK to fetch messages only belonging to these
types.

<CodeGroup>

```js User
let UID = "UID";
let limit = 30;
let categories = ["message"];
let types = ["image", "video", "audio", "file"];
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
  .setUID(UID)
  .setCategories(categories)
  .setTypes(types)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .build();
```

```js Group
let GUID = "GUID";
let limit = 30;
let categories = ["message"];
let types = ["image", "video", "audio", "file"];
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
  .setGUID(GUID)
  .setCategories(categories)
  .setTypes(types)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .build();
```

```ts Typescript (User)
let UID: string = "UID",
  limit: number = 30,
  categories: Array<String> = ["message", "custom"],
  types: Array<String> = ["image", "video", "audio", "file"],
  messagesRequest: CometChat.MessagesRequest =
    new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
      .setUID(UID)
      .setCategories(categories)
      .setTypes(types)
      .setLimit(limit)
      .build();
```

```ts Typescript (Group)
let GUID: string = "GUID",
  limit: number = 30,
  categories: Array<String> = ["message", "custom"],
  types: Array<String> = ["image", "video", "audio", "file"],
  messagesRequest: CometChat.MessagesRequest =
    new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
      .setGUID(GUID)
      .setCategories(categories)
      .setTypes(types)
      .setLimit(limit)
      .build();
```

</CodeGroup>

Using the above code snippet, you can fetch all the media messages.

## Messages for a specific thread

_In other words, how do I fetch messages that are a part of a thread and not
directly a user/group conversations_

This can be done using the `setParentMessageId()` method. This method needs to
be used when you have implemented threaded conversations in your app. This
method will return the messages only belonging to the thread with the specified
parent Id.

<CodeGroup>

```js User
let UID = "UID";
let messageId = 1;
let limit = 30;
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
  .setUID(UID)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .setParentMessageId(messageId)
  .build();
```

```js Group
let GUID = "GUID";
let messageId = 1;
let limit = 30;
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
  .setGUID(GUID)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .setParentMessageId(messageId)
  .build();
```

```ts Typescript (User)
let UID: string = "UID",
  limit: number = 30,
  messageId: number = 1,
  messagesRequest: CometChat.MessagesRequest =
    new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
      .setUID(UID)
      .setLimit(limit)
      .setParentMessageId(messageId)
      .build();
```

```ts Typescript (Group)
let GUID: string = "GUID",
  limit: number = 30,
  messageId: number = 1,
  messagesRequest: CometChat.MessagesRequest =
    new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
      .setGUID(GUID)
      .setLimit(limit)
      .setParentMessageId(messageId)
      .build();
```

</CodeGroup>

The above code snippet returns the messages that belong to the thread with
parent id 100.

## Hide threaded messages in user/group conversations

_In other words, how do I exclude threaded messages from the normal user/group
conversations_

In order to do this, you can use the `hideReplies()` method. This method is also
related to threaded conversations. This method takes boolean as input. This
boolean when set to true will make sure that the messages that belong to threads
are not fetched. If set to false, which is also the default value, the messages
belong to the threads will also be fetched along with other messages.

<CodeGroup>

```js User
let UID = "UID";
let limit = 30;
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
  .setUID(UID)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .hideReplies(true)
  .build();
```

```js Group
let GUID = "GUID";
let limit = 30;
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
  .setGUID(GUID)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .hideReplies(true)
  .build();
```

```ts Typescript (User)
let UID: string = "UID",
  limit: number = 30,
  messagesRequest: CometChat.MessagesRequest =
    new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
      .setUID(UID)
      .setLimit(limit)
      .hideReplies(true)
      .build();
```

```ts Typescript (Group)
let GUID: string = "GUID",
  limit: number = 30,
  messagesRequest: CometChat.MessagesRequest =
    new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
      .setGUID(GUID)
      .setLimit(limit)
      .hideReplies(true)
      .build();
```

</CodeGroup>

## Hide deleted messages in user/group conversations

_In other words, how do I exclude deleted messages a user/group conversations_

In order to do this, you can use the `hideDeletedMessages()` method. This method
takes boolean as input. This boolean when set to true will make sure that the
deleted messages are not fetched. If set to false, which is also the default
value, the deleted messages will also be fetched along with other messages.

<CodeGroup>

```js User
let UID = "UID";
let limit = 30;
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
  .setUID(UID)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .hideDeletedMessages(true)
  .build();
```

```js Group
let GUID = "GUID";
let limit = 30;
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
  .setGUID(GUID)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .hideDeletedMessages(true)
  .build();
```

```ts Typescript (User)
let UID: string = "UID",
  limit: number = 30,
  messagesRequest: CometChat.MessagesRequest =
    new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
      .setUID(UID)
      .setLimit(limit)
      .hideDeletedMessages(true)
      .build();
```

```ts Typescript (Group)
let GUID: string = "GUID",
  limit: number = 30,
  messagesRequest: CometChat.MessagesRequest =
    new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
      .setGUID(GUID)
      .setLimit(limit)
      .hideDeletedMessages(true)
      .build();
```

</CodeGroup>

## Messages by tags

_In other words, how do I fetch messages by tags_

In order to do this, you can use the `setTags()` method. This method accepts a
list of tags. This tells the SDK to fetch messages only belonging to these tags.

<CodeGroup>

```js User
let UID = "UID";
let limit = 30;
let tags = ["starredMessage"];
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
  .setUID(UID)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .setTags(tags)
  .build();
```

```js Group
let GUID = "GUID";
let limit = 30;
let tags = ["starredMessage"];
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
  .setGUID(GUID)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .setTags(tags)
  .build();
```

```ts Typescript (User)
let UID: string = "UID",
  limit: number = 30,
  tags: Array<String> = ["starredMessage"],
  messagesRequest: CometChat.MessagesRequest =
    new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
      .setUID(UID)
      .setLimit(limit)
      .setTags(tags)
      .build();
```

```ts Typescript (Group)
let GUID: string = "GUID",
  limit: number = 30,
  tags: Array<String> = ["starredMessage"],
  messagesRequest: CometChat.MessagesRequest =
    new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
      .setGUID(GUID)
      .setLimit(limit)
      .setTags(tags)
      .build();
```

</CodeGroup>

## Messages with tags

_In other words, how do I fetch messages with the tags information_

In order to do this, you can use the `withTags()` method. This method accepts
boolean as input. When set to true , the SDK will fetch messages along with the
tags. When set to false , the SDK will not fetch tags associated with messages.
The default value for this parameter is false .

<CodeGroup>

```js User
let UID = "UID";
let limit = 30;
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
  .setUID(UID)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .withTags(true)
  .build();
let UID = "UID";
let limit = 30;
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
  .setUID(UID)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .withTags(true)
  .build();
```

```js Group
let GUID = "GUID";
let limit = 30;
let messagesRequest = new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
  .setGUID(GUID)
  .setLimit(limit)
  .withTags(tags)
  .build();
```

```ts Typescript (User)
let UID: string = "UID",
  limit: number = 30,
  messagesRequest: CometChat.MessagesRequest =
    new CometChat.MessagesRequestBuilder()
      .setGUID(UID)
      .setLimit(limit)
      .withTags(true)
      .build();
```

```ts Typescript (Group)

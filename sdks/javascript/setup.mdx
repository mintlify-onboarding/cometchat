**Migrating app version from v2 to v3?**

Skip the create new app step. Your existing v2 app can be migrated to v3.

Follow steps mentioned in **Add the CometChat dependency** section below to
upgrade to latest version of v3

</Note>

## Get your Application Keys

[Signup for CometChat](https://app.cometchat.com/signup) and then:

1. Create a new app
2. Head over to the **API & Auth Keys** section and note the**Auth Key**, **App
   ID** & **Region**

## Add the CometChat Dependency

### NPM

```bash Javascript
npm install @cometchat-pro/chat@3.0.11 --save
```

Then, import the `CometChat` object wherever you want to use CometChat.

```js Javascript
import { CometChat } from "@cometchat-pro/chat";
```

### HTML (via CDN)

Include the CometChat Javascript library in your HTML code.

```html HTML
<script
  type="text/javascript"
  src="https://unpkg.com/@cometchat-pro/chat@3.0.11/CometChat.js"
></script>
```

## Initialize CometChat

The `init()` method initialises the settings required for CometChat. The
`init()` method takes the below parameters:

1. appID - You CometChat App ID
2. appSettings - An object of the AppSettings class can be created using the
   AppSettingsBuilder class. The region field is mandatory and can be set using
   the `setRegion()` method.

The `AppSettings` class allows you to configure two settings:

- **Region**: The region where you app was created.
- [Presence Subscription](/sdks/javascript/user-presence): Represents the
  subscription type for user presence (real-time online/offline status)
- **autoEstablishSocketConnection(boolean value)**: This property takes a
  boolean value which when set to true informs the SDK to manage the web-socket
  connection internally. If set to false , it informs the SDK that the
  web-socket connection will be managed manually. The default value for this
  parameter is true. For more information on this, please check the
  [Managing Web-Socket connections manually](sdks/javascript/web-socket)
  section. The default value for this property is true.
- **overrideAdminHost(adminHost: string)**: This method takes the admin URL as
  input and uses this admin URL instead of the default admin URL. This can be
  used in case of dedicated deployment of CometChat.
- **overrideClientHost(clientHost: string)**: This method takes the client URL
  as input and uses this client URL instead of the default client URL. This can
  be used in case of dedicated deployment of CometChat.

You need to call `init()` before calling any other method from CometChat. We
suggest you call the `init()` method on app startup, preferably in the
`index.js` file.

```js
let appID = "APP_ID";
let region = "APP_REGION";
let appSetting = new CometChat.AppSettingsBuilder()
  .subscribePresenceForAllUsers()
  .setRegion(region)
  .autoEstablishSocketConnection(true)
  .build();
CometChat.init(appID, appSetting).then(
  () => {
    console.log("Initialization completed successfully");
  },
  (error) => {
    console.log("Initialization failed with error:", error);
  }
);
```

```ts
let appID: string = "APP_ID",
  region: string = "APP_REGION",
  appSetting: CometChat.AppSettings = new CometChat.AppSettingsBuilder()
    .subscribePresenceForAllUsers()
    .setRegion(region)
    .autoEstablishSocketConnection(true)
    .build();
CometChat.init(appID, appSetting).then(
  (initialized: boolean) => {
    console.log("Initialization completed successfully", initialized);
  },
  (error: CometChat.CometChatException) => {
    console.log("Initialization failed with error:", error);
  }
);
```

Make sure you replace the `APP_ID` with your CometChat **App ID** and
`APP_REGION` with your **App Region** in the above code.

| Parameter  | Description                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| appID      | CometChat App ID                    |
| appSetting | An object of the AppSettings class. |
